3. Install the remaining requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. Download Pretrained Models
You can manually download the pre-trained models from [here]((https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JB2GhDQge9a6KdVvBl1ELpL-UBRJMYRo)).

### 3. Test Configuration
You can begin by testing your configuration with:

`python demo_cli.py`

The final output and the sample videos along with the pre-trained weights can be found [here]((https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zQgUy52uxaWHPvQimzjLSkvdrV0ydPNe)).
